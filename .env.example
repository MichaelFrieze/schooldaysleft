# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.js"
# should be updated accordingly.

# It's also important to add every possible environment variable in this file 

# Make sure to add dummy values that work with pnpm run lint. To test these dummy values, 
# they need to be copied into the .env file before running pnpm run lint.

# If you are having lint errors on github workflow using the ci.yaml file, it might be
# caused by this file.
